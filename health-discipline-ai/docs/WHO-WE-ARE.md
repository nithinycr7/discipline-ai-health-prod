# Health Discipline AI — Who We Are

## What Our Product Does

Health Discipline AI is a daily wellness companion that checks on your parents through warm AI voice calls — tracking their health, medicines, mood, and vitals when you can't be there yourself.

**In simple words:** We call your parent every day in their language, check on how they're doing, verify their medicines and vitals, and send you a clear picture of their actual wellbeing.

- No apps for parents.
- No diagnosis.
- No guessing.

## What Happens Every Day

### 1. Voice Call
We place a scheduled phone call to the patient — in their preferred language, at the right time of day.

### 2. Wellness Check-in
During the call, we:
- Ask how they're feeling today
- Check each medicine by name
- Ask about BP / sugar readings (if enabled)
- Listen for concerns, complaints, or mood changes

### 3. Data Capture
We record facts, not opinions:
- Which medicines were taken / missed
- Whether BP / sugar was measured
- The numbers shared by the patient
- Condition-specific screening — once or twice a week, we ask the right question for their condition (fasting sugar for diabetes, BP reading for hypertension, swelling for heart failure, muscle pain for statin users, and more). Not daily, not generic — just enough to catch problems early without tiring them out.
- Mood and sentiment — tone of voice, energy level, how they're really feeling
- Any simple notes in the patient's words

**This is not a robotic call.** It's a warm caretaker conversation. We analyse tone, mood, and sentiment so the family sees how their parent is really feeling, not just what they said.

### 4. Data Structuring
Everything is time-stamped, patient-specific, stored as structured data, and auditable later.

### 5. Family Visibility
After the call:
- A WhatsApp summary is sent to family
- A simple dashboard is updated

## What the Family Gets

- Daily certainty about how their parent is really doing
- A single source of truth — medicines, vitals, mood
- A history they can share with doctors
- Alerts when something seems off

They don't need to interpret anything — they just see the truth.

---

## What We Do NOT Do

- We do not diagnose
- We do not give medical advice
- We do not judge readings
- We do not decide emergencies

We collect and surface data only.

---

## Our Role in One Sentence

**We are the daily wellness intelligence layer — we check on your parents so you always know how they're really doing.**

---

## Why This Is Powerful

Most health systems fail at consistency, not intelligence.

- Medicines are forgotten
- Readings aren't written down
- Families are blind
- Doctors lack longitudinal data

We fix consistency and visibility.

---

## What This Allows Later

Because we're a data layer, we can later add:
- Pregnancy routines
- Vaccination schedules
- Deeper chronic disease tracking — condition-specific protocols for diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, COPD, kidney disease, thyroid, and more, each with clinically appropriate screening frequency
- Post-discharge follow-ups

Same product. Same promise. New routines.

## Positioning

**External:** "Know how your parents are really doing — every single day."

**Internal:** "If it didn't get recorded, it didn't happen."

**The line that wins deals:** "Families don't pay us to remind their parents. They pay because they're tired of wondering if everything is actually okay."

## How We Talk About It (Sales Objections)

### "I already call my mom every day. Why should I pay for this?"

We don't replace you. We make sure there's never a day when nobody checked — and you get a record of it. What happens on the days you don't call, or when she says "haan le li" and you don't know if it's true?

### "She'll just tell your system the same thing she tells me."

That does happen sometimes — and that's okay. The difference is: we ask about each medicine by name, at the same time every day, in her language, and we record it. When patterns change — missed days, delayed answers, shorter responses — you'll see it immediately. Right now, you have no way to see patterns. You only have conversations.

### "Isn't this just a reminder system?"

Not at all. Reminders tell people what to do. We check on how they're actually doing — their medicines, their mood, their vitals, their wellbeing. Every day ends with a clear picture: how is your parent really doing? Most health issues don't escalate because of one missed pill — they escalate because nobody noticed the small changes adding up.

### "₹1,500/month still feels expensive for phone calls."

Most families pay this after one of these things happens: a sugar spike they didn't see coming, a BP issue noticed too late, or a hospitalization they wish they'd prevented. This isn't paying for calls. It's paying so that nothing goes unnoticed for months.

### "What if I try it and don't find it useful?"

That's exactly why we give you a free trial. In 7 days, you'll see: did the calls get answered? Did routines actually happen? Did you worry less? If it doesn't reduce your mental load, you shouldn't pay. No pressure.

## Sampurna (Complete Care) — What Sets It Apart

For families who need more than monitoring:
- **Human verification on missed routines** — if a routine is missed, a real person follows up
- **Priority outreach** — faster response when something is off
- **Escalation to local contact** — if the patient can't be reached, we alert a nearby family member or local contact
