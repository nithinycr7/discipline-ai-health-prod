## Go-To-Market Phases

### Phase 1: Founder-Led Sales (Month 1-3)

**Goal:** First 50 paying users. Prove product-market fit.

| Channel | Action | Target |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Personal network | Direct outreach to NRIs in personal circle | 10 users |
| WhatsApp groups | NRI community groups (US, UK, UAE) | 15 users |
| Doctor referrals | 5-10 friendly doctors recommend to patient families | 15 users |
| LinkedIn | Founder posts about the problem (not product) | 10 users |

**Playbook:**
1. Post on LinkedIn about the problem (not the product) — "My mom takes 5 medicines a day. I live 10,000 km away. Every evening I call and ask 'Dawai li?' She always says yes. But did she really?"
2. DM people who engage with the post
3. Offer free 7-day trial with personal onboarding help
4. After 1 week of successful calls, ask for referral: "Would you share this with other families?"
5. Collect testimonials from every early user

### Phase 2: Channel Development (Month 3-6)

**Goal:** 200 paying users. Build repeatable channels.

| Channel | Action | Target |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Doctor partnerships | Formal referral program with commission | 50 users |
| NRI associations | Partner with Indian associations in US/UK/UAE cities | 40 users |
| Content marketing | SEO + social content targeting "elderly care India" | 30 users |
| WhatsApp Business | Automated onboarding + referral program | 30 users |
| Hospital pilot | 1-2 hospital partnerships (B2B) | 50 patients |

### Phase 3: Paid Acquisition (Month 6-12)

**Goal:** 1,000+ users. Scale proven channels.

| Channel | Action | Budget |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram) | Target NRIs in US, UK, UAE — emotional video ads | INR 50K/month |

| YouTube | 60-second demo + testimonial videos | INR 20K/month |
| Influencer partnerships | NRI lifestyle creators, health influencers | INR 30K/month |
| **Total** | | **INR 1.3L/month** |

**Target CAC:** INR 300-500 per paying user (at INR 999/month subscription, payback in <1 month)

---

## Marketing Channels

### 1. WhatsApp (Highest Priority)

WhatsApp is the primary communication channel for both NRIs and Indian families. Every touchpoint should have a WhatsApp entry point.

**Strategies:**
- Onboarding happens entirely via WhatsApp (conversational, not forms)
- Post-call reports delivered via WhatsApp
- Referral sharing via WhatsApp forward (pre-filled message)
- Weekly "Did you know?" health tips (engagement)
- Trial expiry reminders via WhatsApp

**WhatsApp Status/Stories:** Template messages showing anonymized call highlights:
> "Today we checked on 1,247 parents across India. 94% took all their medicines."

### 2. Doctor Referral Network

Doctors are the most trusted source for health decisions. A doctor saying "try this" is worth 100 ads.

**Program:**
- Doctor gets a unique referral code
- Family signs up mentioning doctor → doctor gets INR 200/referral (or free months for their practice)
- Doctor receives monthly summary of their referred patients' adherence (with consent)
- Co-branded prescription pad inserts: "Monitor medicine adherence with Health Discipline AI"
- Annual "Top Referring Doctors" recognition

**Targets:**
- Endocrinologists (diabetes patients — highest medicine counts)
- Cardiologists (BP, heart disease — critical medicines)
- General physicians in Tier 2/3 cities (high volume)

### 3. NRI Community Hubs

| Platform | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| **NRI WhatsApp Groups** | Share emotional stories, not product pitches. Be a community member first. |
| **Indian Associations (US/UK/UAE)** | Sponsor health talks at IAGB, FIA, IALI events. Offer free trial codes. |
| **Temple/Gurdwara/Community Events** | QR code standees at Indian community events abroad |
| **LinkedIn** | Target NRI professionals aged 30-50 with "peace of mind" messaging |
| **YouTube** | Testimonial videos: "How I stopped worrying about Amma's medicines" |
| **Reddit** | r/ABCDesis, r/India — authentic problem-focused posts |

### 4. SEO & Organic Search

**Target Keywords:**

| Keyword | Intent | Difficulty |
|---------|--------|:----------:|
| "medicine reminder for parents in India" | High intent | Low |
| "elderly care from abroad" | High intent | Low |
| "how to make sure parents take medicines" | Problem aware | Medium |
| "AI health assistant for elderly India" | Solution aware | Low |
| "NRI parent care" | Problem aware | Low |
| "medication adherence elderly" | B2B/clinical | Medium |
| "post discharge medication monitoring" | B2B | Low |

**Blog Cadence:** 2 posts/month targeting long-tail keywords

### 5. Social Media

| Platform | Content Type | Frequency | Audience |
|----------|-------------|:---------:|----------|
| LinkedIn | Founder stories, problem posts, milestones | 3x/week | NRI professionals |
| Instagram | Emotional reels, demo clips, family stories | 4x/week | NRI families |
| YouTube | Demo video, testimonials, explainers | 2x/month | All |
| Twitter/X | Industry insights, health stats | 2x/week | B2B, health tech |

## Messaging by Audience

### NRI Child (Decision Maker & Payer)

| Funnel Stage | Message |
|-------------|---------|
| **Awareness** | "You call them every day asking 'Dawai li?' — and they always say yes. But did they really?" |
| **Interest** | "What if someone called your parents daily in their language, checked each medicine by name, and sent you the truth?" |
| **Consideration** | "Health Discipline AI calls your parents daily, checks each medicine by name, and sends you a real WhatsApp report." |
| **Conversion** | "Try free for 7 days. If your parent doesn't like the calls, cancel with one WhatsApp message." |
| **Retention** | "Bauji's weekly report: 92% adherence. Missed Metformin on Wednesday. Wellness: good all week." |
| **Referral** | "Know someone else who worries about their parents' health? Share your referral link — both families get a free week." |

### Elderly Parent (End User)

| Touchpoint | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| **Introduction** | "Aapke bete ne yeh seva shuru ki hai — har din aapko yaad dilane ke liye" (Your child started this — to remind you every day) |
| **During Call** | Warm, familiar, respectful — uses their preferred name and medicine nicknames in their language |
| **After Call** | No action needed. They just answer and talk. |

> The parent never needs to understand it's a "product." To them, it's just a caring person who calls every day.

### Hospital Admin (B2B)

| Funnel Stage | Message |
|-------------|---------|
| **Awareness** | "Your outpatients stop taking medicines 2 weeks after discharge. You don't know until they're readmitted." |
| **Interest** | "What if you could check on every discharged patient, every day, without hiring a single nurse?" |
| **Consideration** | "AI voice calls check on every patient daily at 1/100th the cost of nurse follow-up. Structured data, not notes." |
| **Conversion** | "Pilot with 50 patients free for 2 weeks. See the adherence data." |
| **Retention** | Monthly adherence reports per doctor, per department. Readmission rate correlation. |

## Content Strategy

### Emotional Content (Top of Funnel)

Stories and scenarios that resonate with the NRI audience. These drive shares and awareness.

1. **"The 3 AM worry"** — Blog/video about NRIs lying awake wondering if parents took their BP medicine
2. **"Haan beti, le li"** — The universal Indian response to "Did you take your medicine?" — and why it's never the full truth
3. **"10,000 km between us, 1 phone call bridges it"** — Emotional brand film (60 sec)
4. **Real call recordings** (with consent) — Show how natural and warm the AI conversation sounds
5. **Before/After** — "Before: daily guilt calls. After: WhatsApp report while I'm at work."

### Educational Content (Middle of Funnel)

Build credibility and trust. Position as thought leaders in elderly care.

1. **"Why medication non-adherence kills more than the disease"** — Data-driven blog with WHO stats
2. **"The tech-free revolution in elderly care"** — Thought leadership on voice-first interfaces
3. **"How we built an AI that speaks like family"** — Behind the scenes for tech-curious audience
4. **Doctor interviews** — "Why I recommend Health Discipline to my patients' families"
5. **"8 languages, 1 billion elders"** — The localization story

### Conversion Content (Bottom of Funnel)

Drive signups and trial activations.

1. **Demo video** — 2-minute walkthrough: registration → first call → WhatsApp report
2. **Testimonials** — Video/text from 3-5 families using the service
3. **Comparison page** — vs. reminder apps, vs. manual calls, vs. nurse services, vs. doing nothing
4. **Pricing calculator** — "How much does worrying about your parents cost you?" (emotional + financial)
5. **FAQ page** — Address every objection transparently

### Content Calendar (Sample Month)

| Week | Monday | Wednesday | Friday |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | LinkedIn: Founder story about the problem | Instagram Reel: 30-sec demo clip | Blog: "The real cost of not knowing" |
| 2 | LinkedIn: Data on medication non-adherence | Instagram: Testimonial quote card | YouTube: Full demo video |
| 3 | LinkedIn: Behind the scenes — how the AI works | Instagram Reel: "Before vs After" | Blog: "5 signs your parents need help" |
| 4 | LinkedIn: Milestone post (X parents checked on) | Instagram: Doctor endorsement | YouTube: Testimonial interview |

## Sales Playbooks

### B2C: NRI Outreach Script (LinkedIn DM)

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [you're in the US with parents in India / your post about elderly care].

We built something that might help — an AI that calls your parents daily
in [Hindi/their language], asks about each medicine by name, and sends
you a WhatsApp report.

No app needed. No tech skills required from your parents. They just
answer a phone call.

Would your family find this useful? I can set up a free 7-day trial
in 10 minutes.

[Link to WhatsApp onboarding]
```

### B2C: WhatsApp Forward Message (Referral)

```
Hey! I started using this for my parents — an AI calls them daily
in Hindi, checks if they took their medicines, and sends me a report
on WhatsApp.

Amma actually likes the calls! No app needed, she just picks up the phone.

Try it free for 7 days: [link]
```

### B2B: Hospital Cold Email

```
Subject: Cut outpatient follow-up costs by 99%

Hi Dr. [Name],

Post-discharge medication non-adherence is your hospital's hidden cost
center. Manual nurse calls work but don't scale.

Health Discipline AI replaces those calls with an AI voice agent that:
- Calls each patient daily in their language
- Checks every prescribed medicine by name
- Reports adherence data to your dashboard in real-time
- Costs ~INR 10/patient/day (vs INR 100+ for nurse calls)

Want to pilot with 50 patients for 2 weeks — free?

Best,
[Name]
[Title], Health Discipline AI

P.S. We're DPDP Act compliant. Happy to share our data security documentation.
```

### B2B: Hospital Follow-Up (After Pilot)

```
Subject: Your pilot results — 87% adherence across 50 patients

Hi Dr. [Name],

Here are the results from your 2-week pilot:

- 50 patients monitored
- 87% overall medication adherence
- 12 critical medicine misses detected and alerted
- 3 patients reported symptoms that were escalated
- Average call duration: 2.1 minutes

At INR 150/patient/month, that's INR 7,500/month for daily monitoring
of all 50 patients — less than one nurse's daily salary.

Ready to discuss scaling to your full outpatient list?

[CTA: Schedule call]

## Referral Program

### Structure

| Action | Reward |
|--------|--------|
| Refer a family that signs up for trial | Both get 1 free week added |
| Referred family converts to paid | Referrer gets 1 free month |
| Refer 5+ families | "Health Champion" badge + 2 free months |
| Doctor refers 10+ families | Free doctor dashboard access |

### Referral Triggers (When to Ask)

| Moment | Why |
|--------|-----|
| After first successful call | "Amma loved the call! Know someone who'd benefit?" |
| Weekly report delivery | Include referral link at bottom |
| After 30 days (loyalty milestone) | "You've been with us for a month! Share with others?" |
| After adherence improvement | "Bauji's adherence went from 60% to 92%! Share your experience?" |

---

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "My parents won't talk to a robot" | "The AI sounds like a real person calling in their own language. It uses their name — 'Namaste Bauji!' Most patients love the daily check-in. Try free for 7 days and see." |
| "They already have a reminder app" | "Can your parent use it? 200M elderly Indians can't operate smartphone apps. Our AI calls them — they just pick up the phone. Zero tech needed." |
| "It's expensive" | "Less than INR 33/day — less than a cup of chai. Compare that to a hospital readmission because they missed their BP medicine for a week." |
| "What if they don't pick up?" | "We retry twice at 30-minute intervals. If still no answer, you get an immediate WhatsApp alert so you can check on them." |
| "Is their data safe?" | "DPDP Act compliant. Data encrypted in transit and at rest. You can export or delete all data anytime from the dashboard." |
| "I can just call them myself" | "You can! But can you call at 8:30 AM IST from a different timezone, every single day, and track which medicines were taken? We supplement your calls, not replace your relationship." |
| "What about language barriers?" | "We support 8 Indian languages — Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, Gujarati, and English. The AI speaks in your parent's preferred language." |
| "We already have nurses for this" (B2B) | "Great — but at what cost and scale? AI calls cost INR 10/patient/day vs INR 100+ for a nurse call. And it generates structured data, not handwritten notes." |
